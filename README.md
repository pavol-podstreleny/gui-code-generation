# Graphical User Interface generation 
Android mobile application that transforms row graphical user interfaces input image into a hierarchical structure of views that are rendered on the screen. The application uses a machine learning model to predict individual views / view-groups at runtime. ML model was trained on the [pix2code](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code) dataset and currently is not available.
